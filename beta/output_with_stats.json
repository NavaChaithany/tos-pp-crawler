That's our commitment.   Our Vision Statement Welcome to Wikimedia! The Wikimedia Foundation Inc. ( we or us or Foundation ) is a non-profit charitable organization headquartered in San Francisco California United States whose mission is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop content under a free license or in the public domain and to disseminate it effectively and globally free of charge. To support our vibrant community we provide the essential infrastructure and organizational framework for the development of multilingual wiki projects and their editions (as explained on our Wikimedia Projects page ) (hereby referred to as Projects ) and other endeavors which serve this mission. We strive to make and keep educational and informational content from the Projects available on the internet free of charge in perpetuity. We welcome you ( you or the user ) as a reader or contributor of the Projects and we encourage you to join the Wikimedia community. Before you participate however we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Use ( Terms of Use ). Overview These Terms of Use tell you about our public services at the Wikimedia Foundation our relationship to you as a user and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. We host an incredible quantity of educational and informational content all of which is contributed and made possible by users like yourself. Generally we do not contribute monitor or delete content (with rare exceptions such as under policies like these Terms of Use for legal compliance or when faced with urgent threats of serious harm). This means that editorial control is in the hands of you and your fellow users who create and manage the content. The community   the network of users who are constantly building and using the Projects and/or their websites (hereby referred to as Project Websites )   is the principal means through which the goals of the mission are achieved. The community contributes to and helps govern our Projects and Project Websites. The community also undertakes the critical function of creating and enforcing policies for the specific Project editions (such as the different language editions for the Wikipedia Project or the Wikimedia Commons multilingual edition). You the user are welcome to join as a contributor editor or author but you should follow the policies that govern each of the independent Project editions including the Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) which apply to all Project editions. The largest of our Projects is Wikipedia but we host other Projects too each with different objectives and work methods. Each Project edition has a team of contributors editors or authors who work together to create and manage the content on that Project edition. You are welcome to join these teams and work with them to improve these Projects. Since we are dedicated to making content freely accessible to the public content you contribute is made available under a free license or released in the public domain. Please be aware that you are legally responsible for all of your contributions edits and reuse of Wikimedia content under the laws of the United States of America and other applicable laws (which may include laws where you or the subject of your contributions are located). This means it is important that you exercise caution when posting modifying or reusing content. In light of this responsibility we have some rules about what you cannot do most of which are either for your own protection or for the protection of other users like yourself. Please keep in mind that the content we host is for general informational purposes only so if you need expert advice for a particular question (such as medical legal or financial issues) you should seek the help of an appropriate professional. We also include other important notices and disclaimers so please read these Terms of Use in their entirety. For clarity other organizations such as local Wikimedia chapters and associations that may share in the same mission are nevertheless legally independent and separate from the Wikimedia Foundation. Unless otherwise stated by the Foundation as an authorized party on a given Project's Website those other organizations have no responsibility for the operations of the Project's Website or its content. . Our Services The Wikimedia Foundation is dedicated to encouraging the growth development and distribution of free multilingual content and to hosting the full content of these wiki-based Projects for the public free of charge. Our role is to host some of the largest collaboratively edited reference Projects in the world which can be found here . However we act only as a hosting service provider maintaining the infrastructure and organizational framework. This infrastructure and framework allow our users to build the Projects by contributing and editing content themselves. They also allow our users to reuse that content. The infrastructure we maintain includes specialized technological infrastructure that enables users to programmatically interact with and reuse content on Projects (referred to as Application Programming Interface or APIs ) and mobile applications. As used throughout the rest of the Terms of Use our services consist of: The Project Websites we host technological infrastructure that we maintain and any technical spaces that we host for the maintenance and improvement of our Projects. Because of our unique role there are a couple of things you should be aware of when considering our relationship to you the Projects and other users: We do not take an editorial role: Because the Projects are collaboratively edited the vast majority of the content that we host is provided by users and we do not take an editorial role. This means that we generally do not monitor or edit the content of the Project Websites and we do not take any responsibility for this content. Similarly unless we have expressly stated otherwise we do not endorse any opinions expressed via our services and we do not represent or guarantee the truthfulness accuracy or reliability of any submitted community content on the Projects. You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the Projects your reuse of content on the Projects your use of the APIs and your use of our services more generally. For your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid taking any actions that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws. For clarity applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States of America and the State of California. For other countries this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Although we may not agree with such actions we warn users particularly the editors contributors and authors that non-U.S. authorities may seek to apply other country laws to you including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content. We generally cannot offer any protection guarantee immunity or indemnification against the application of such laws. . Privacy Policy We ask that you review the terms of our Privacy Policy so that you are aware of how we collect and use your information. . Content We Host You may find some material objectionable or erroneous: Because we host a wide array of content that is produced or gathered by fellow users you may encounter material that you find offensive erroneous misleading mislabeled or otherwise objectionable. We therefore ask that you use common sense and proper judgment when using our services. The Projects' content is for general informational purposes only: Although our Projects host a great deal of information that pertains to professional topics including medical legal or financial issues this content is presented for general informational purposes only. It should not be taken as professional advice. Please seek independent professional counseling from someone who is licensed or qualified in the applicable area in lieu of acting on any information opinion or advice contained in one of the Project Websites. . Refraining from Certain Activities The Projects hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation only exist because of the vibrant community of users like you who collaborate to write edit and curate the content. We happily welcome your participation in this community. We encourage you to be civil and polite in your interactions with others in the community to act in good faith and to make edits and contributions aimed at furthering the mission of the shared Project. We ask that all users review and follow the Universal Code of Conduct ( UCoC ) which lays out requirements for collegial civil collaboration across all Projects that we host. Certain activities whether legal or illegal under the applicable law may be harmful to other users and violate our rules and some activities may also subject you to liability. Therefore for your own protection and for that of other users you may not engage in such activities on or otherwise using our Projects. These activities include: Harassing and Abusing Others Engaging in threats stalking spamming vandalism or harassment as described in the UCoC; Transmitting chain mail junk mail or spam to other users; Posting or modifying content with the intention to seriously harm others such as deliberate inducements to self-harm or deliberate triggering of epilepsy. Violating the Privacy of Others Infringing the privacy rights of others under the laws of the United States of America or other applicable laws (which may include the laws where you live or where you view or edit content); Soliciting personally identifiable information for the purposes of harassment exploitation or violation of privacy or for any promotional or commercial purpose not explicitly approved by the Wikimedia Foundation; and Soliciting personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of years or under the age of majority where you are if higher than years for an illegal purpose or violating any applicable law regarding the health or well-being of minors. Engaging in False Statements Impersonation or Fraud Intentionally or knowingly posting content that constitutes libel or defamation under the laws of the United States of America; Posting or modifying content with the intent to deceive or mislead others; Attempting to impersonate another user or individual misrepresenting your affiliation with any individual or entity hiding your affiliation with any individual or entity when disclosure is required by these terms or local Project policy or using the name or username of another person with the intent to deceive; and Engaging in fraud. Committing Infringement of Intellectual Property Rights Infringing copyrights trademarks patents or other proprietary rights under the applicable law. Misusing Our Services for Other Illegal Purposes Posting child pornography or any other content that violates applicable law concerning child pornography or child sexual abuse material or encouraging grooming or advocating for others to create or share such material; Posting or trafficking in obscene material that is unlawful under applicable law; and Using the services in a manner that is inconsistent with applicable law. Engaging in Disruptive and Illegal Misuse of Facilities Posting or distributing content that contains any viruses malware worms Trojan horses malicious code or other device that could harm our technical infrastructure or system or that of other users; Engaging in automated uses of the Project Websites that are abusive or disruptive of the services violate acceptable usage policies where available or have not been approved by the Wikimedia community; Disrupting the services by placing an undue burden on an API Project Website or the networks or servers connected with a particular Project Website; Disrupting the services by inundating any of the Project Websites with communications or other traffic that suggests no serious intent to use the Project website for its stated purpose; Knowingly accessing tampering with or using any of our non-public areas in our computer systems without authorization; and Probing scanning or testing the vulnerability of any of our technical systems or networks unless all the following conditions are met: such actions do not unduly abuse or disrupt our technical systems or networks; such actions are not for personal gain (except for credit for your work); you report any vulnerabilities to the relevant developers (or fix it yourself); and you do not undertake such actions with malicious or destructive intent. Shortcut : PAID Paid Contributions Without Disclosure You must disclose each and any employer client intended beneficiary and affiliation with respect to any contribution for which you receive or expect to receive compensation. You must make that disclosure in at least one of the following ways: a statement on your user page a statement on the talk page accompanying any paid contributions or a statement in the edit summary accompanying any paid contributions. In addition if you make a public posting off the Projects advertising editing services on Wikipedia in exchange for compensation of any kind you must disclose all Wikipedia accounts you have used or will use for this service in the public posting on the third-party service. Applicable law or Project-specific policies and Foundation policies and guidelines such as those addressing conflicts of interest may further limit paid contributions or require more detailed disclosure. For example infringing Wikimedia Trademarks (defined hereinafter at Section ) to advertise paid editing services removing disclosures on previously adequately disclosed paid edits or logged-out paid editing in a manner that makes adequate disclosure a practical impossibility violate this section. A Wikimedia Project community may adopt an alternative paid contribution disclosure policy which may supplement or replace this section. If a Project adopts an alternative disclosure policy you may comply with that policy instead of the requirements in this section (titled Paid Contributions Without Disclosure ) when contributing to that particular Project. For more information please read our FAQ on disclosure of paid contributions . We reserve the right to exercise our enforcement discretion with respect to the provisions in section of these Terms of Use. Where required enforcement of these terms may include actions not listed in the Wikimedia Foundation Office Action Policy . If enforcement is required in new circumstances we will make an effort within at most one () year to update the Office Action Policy to catalog the new type of action. Marketing Company Mediations Undisclosed editing by users receiving compensation creates an unreasonable burden on volunteer editors who investigate and enforce community policies . Therefore for violations of this section related to undisclosed paid editing you agree to submit to binding Med-Arb (a Marketing Company Mediation ) as described in section of these Terms of Use. . Password Security You are responsible for safeguarding your own password and other security credentials and should never disclose them to any third party. . Trademarks Although you have considerable freedoms for reuse of the content on the Project Websites it is important that at the Wikimedia Foundation we protect our trademark rights so that we can protect our users from fraudulent impersonators. Because of this we ask that you please respect our trademarks. All Wikimedia Foundation trademarks belong to the Wikimedia Foundation and any use of our trade names trademarks service marks logos or domain names must be in compliance with these Terms of Use and in compliance with our Trademark Policy . . Licensing of Content To grow the commons of free knowledge and free culture all users contributing to the Projects or Project Websites are required to grant broad permissions to the general public to redistribute and reuse their contributions freely so long as that use is properly attributed and the same freedom to reuse and redistribute is granted to any derivative works. In keeping with our goal of providing free information to the widest possible audience we require that when necessary all submitted content be licensed so that it is freely reusable by anyone who may access it. You agree to the following licensing requirements: Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you hold the copyright you agree to license it under: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike . International License ( CC BY-SA . ) and GNU Free Documentation License ( GFDL ) (unversioned with no invariant sections front-cover texts or back-cover texts). Reusers may comply with either license or both. The only exception is if the Project edition or feature requires a different license. In that case you agree to license any text you contribute under the particular license prescribed by the Project edition or the feature. Please note that these licenses do allow commercial uses of your contributions as long as such uses are compliant with the terms of the respective licenses. Where you own Sui Generis Database Rights covered by CC BY-SA . you waive these rights. As an example this means facts you contribute to the projects may be reused freely without attribution. Attribution: Attribution is an important part of these licenses. We consider it giving credit where credit is due   to authors like yourself. When you contribute text you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article to which you contributed (since each article has a history page that lists all contributors authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative stable online copy that is freely accessible which conforms with the relevant license and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). Importing text: You may import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others but in such case you represent and warrant that the text is available under terms that are compatible with CC BY-SA (or as explained above another license when exceptionally required by the Project edition or feature). For a list of compatible licenses see Creative Commons . You shall not import content that is available solely under GFDL. You agree that if you import text under a CC license that requires attribution you must credit the author(s) in a reasonable fashion. Where such credit is commonly given through page histories (such as Wikimedia-internal copying) it is sufficient to give attribution in the edit summary which is recorded in the page history when importing the text. The attribution requirements are sometimes too intrusive for particular circumstances (regardless of the license) and there may be instances where the Wikimedia community decides that imported text cannot be used for that reason. Non-text media: Non-text media on the Projects are available under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted reuse and redistribution. When you contribute non-text media you agree to comply with the requirements for such licenses as described in our Licensing Policy and also comply with the requirements of the specific Project edition or feature to which you are contributing. Also see the Wikimedia Commons Licensing Policy for more information on contributing non-text media to Wikimedia Commons. No revocation of license: Except as consistent with your license you agree that you will not unilaterally revoke or seek invalidation of any license that you have granted under these Terms of Use for text content or non-text media contributed to the Projects or features even if you terminate use of our services. Public domain content: Content that is in the public domain is welcome. It is important however that you confirm the public domain status of the content under the law of the United States of America as well as the laws of any other countries as required by the specific Project edition. When you contribute content that is in the public domain you warrant that the material is actually in the public domain and you agree to label it appropriately. Re-use: Reuse of content that we host is welcome though exceptions exist for content contributed under fair use or similar exemptions under applicable copyright law. Any reuse must comply with the underlying license(s). When you reuse or redistribute a text page developed by the Wikimedia community you agree to attribute the authors in any of the following fashions: Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages that you are reusing (since each page has a history page that lists all contributors authors and editors); Through hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative stable online copy that is freely accessible which conforms with the license and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on the Project Website; or Through a list of all authors (but please note that any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions). If the text content was imported from another source it is possible that the content is licensed under a compatible CC BY-SA license but not GFDL (as described in Importing text above). In that case you agree to comply with the compatible CC BY-SA license and do not have the option to relicense it under GFDL. To determine the license that applies to the content that you seek to reuse or redistribute you should review the page footer page history and discussion page. In addition please be aware that text that originated from external sources and was imported into a Project may be under a license that attaches additional attribution requirements. Users agree to indicate these additional attribution requirements clearly. Depending on the Project such requirements may appear for example in a banner or other notations pointing out that some or all of the content was originally published elsewhere. Where there are such visible notations reusers should preserve them. For any non-text media you agree to comply with the applicable license under which the work has been made available (which can be discovered by clicking on the work and looking at the licensing section on its description page or reviewing an applicable source page for that work). When reusing any content that we host you agree to comply with the relevant attribution requirements as they pertain to the underlying license or licenses. Modifications or additions to material that you reuse: When modifying or making additions to text that you have obtained from a Project Website you agree to license the modified or added content under CC BY-SA . or later (or as explained above another license when exceptionally required by the specific Project edition or feature). When modifying or making additions to any non-text media that you have obtained from a Project website you agree to license the modified or added content in accordance with whatever license under which the work has been made available. With both text content and non-text media you agree to clearly indicate that the original work has been modified. If you are reusing text content in a wiki it is sufficient to indicate in the page history that you made a change to the imported text. For each copy or modified version that you distribute you agree to include a licensing notice stating which license the work is released under along with either a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or a copy of the license itself. . DMCA Compliance The Wikimedia Foundation wants to ensure that the content that we host can be reused by other users without fear of liability and that it is not infringing the proprietary rights of others. In fairness to our users as well as to other creators and copyright holders our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the formalities of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ). Pursuant to the DMCA we will terminate in appropriate circumstances users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers on our Projects and services. However we also recognize that not every takedown notice is valid or in good faith. In such cases we strongly encourage users to file counter-notifications when they appropriately believe a DMCA takedown demand is invalid or improper. For more information on what to do if you think a DMCA notice has been improperly filed you may wish to consult the Lumen Database website. If you are the owner of content that is being improperly used on one of the Projects without your permission you may request that the content be removed by filing a notice under the DMCA. To make such a request please email us at legal wikimedia org or snail mail our designated agent . Alternatively you may make a request to our community which often handles copyright issues faster and more effectively than the process prescribed under the DMCA. In that case you can post a notice explaining your copyright concerns. For a non-exhaustive and non-authoritative list of the relevant processes for the different Project editions visit the Copyright Problems page . Before filing a DMCA claim you also have the option of sending an email to the community at info wikimedia org . . Third-party Websites and Resources You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although the Projects and Project Websites contain links to third-party websites and resources we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability accuracy or the related content products or services (including without limitation any viruses or other disabling features) nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content. . Management of Websites The community has the primary role in creating and enforcing policies applying to the different Project editions. At the Wikimedia Foundation we rarely intervene in community decisions about policy and its enforcement. It is possible to notify us of illegal content or content that violates our Terms of Use (including all policies and other documents incorporated by reference) for other reasons by contacting us directly . However you can typically make a request directly to the Project's community: this may be more efficient and is more consistent with our Projects' aim to empower the user community. Each Project will usually provide Help or Contact pages for further guidance or specific tools for reporting issues. Alternatively   if in doubt   you can ask members of the community for help by sending an email to info wikimedia org or a more language-specific address from the Volunteer Response Team page . Please note that these mailboxes are monitored by users of the Projects not the Foundation. As a result they should not be threatened or issued with legal demands. If you contact the Foundation with a problem we will typically explore whether and how existing community-led mechanisms can investigate and where appropriate resolve it. In an unusual case the need may arise or the community may ask us to address an especially problematic user or especially problematic content because of significant Project disturbance or dangerous behavior. In such cases we reserve the right at our sole discretion (or where legally compelled) to: Investigate your use of the Projects or our services (a) to determine whether a violation of these Terms of Use Project edition policy or other applicable law or policy has occurred or (b) to comply with any applicable law legal process or an appropriate governmental request; Detect prevent or otherwise address fraud false or unverifiable information security or technical issues or respond to user support requests; Refuse revert disable or restrict access to contributions of any user who violates these Terms of Use; Ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access for actions violating these Terms of Use including repeat posting of unlawful material under applicable law in line with human rights principles; Take legal action against users who violate these Terms of Use (including reports to law enforcement authorities); and Manage otherwise the Project websites in a manner designed to facilitate their proper functioning and protect the rights property and safety of ourselves and our users licensors partners and the public. Those Foundation moderation activities may be informed or performed by software (such as traffic flood ( Denial of Service ) protection). In those cases human review is normally available upon request . In the interests of our users and the Projects in the extreme circumstance that any individual has had their account or access blocked under this section they are prohibited from creating or using another account on or seeking access to the same Project unless we provide explicit permission. Without limiting the authority of the community the Foundation itself will not ban a user from editing or contributing or block a user's account or access solely because of good faith criticism that does not result in actions otherwise violating these Terms of Use or community policies. The Wikimedia community and its members may also take action when so allowed by the community or Foundation policies applicable to the specific Project edition including but not limited to warning investigating blocking or banning users who violate those policies. You agree to comply with the final decisions of dispute resolution bodies that are established by the community for the specific Project editions (such as arbitration committees); these decisions may include sanctions as set out by the policy of the specific Project edition. Especially problematic users who have had accounts or access blocked on multiple Project editions may be subject to a ban from all of the Project editions in accordance with the Global Ban Policy . In contrast to Board resolutions or these Terms of Use policies established by the community which may cover a single Project edition or multiple Projects editions (like the Global Ban Policy) may be modified by the relevant community according to its own procedures. The blocking of an account or access or the banning of a user under this provision shall be in accordance with Section of these Terms of Use. If you believe we have not satisfactorily acted on a problematic content report or if you have been subjected to a Foundation moderation action that you wish to challenge you may be able to submit an appeal . Other information about routes of appeal may also be explained to you at the time or in Project-specific help pages. We reserve the right to suspend (temporarily or permanently) our handling of reports or other correspondence from users or third parties whether about allegedly illegal or otherwise problematic content or conduct or requesting appeals against moderation actions if such correspondence was made in bad faith repetitive unfounded and/or abusive. In appropriate circumstances your email address may even be blocked on our email system(s) and you will then need to contact us at our postal address if you wish to further correspond with us during that block. For less serious cases (e.g. up to three polite emails about one or more meritless complaints) this is likely to be temporary. More frequent or more abusive communications are more likely to lead to permanent measures. . Resolutions and Project Policies The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees releases official policies from time to time. Some of these policies may be mandatory for a particular Project or Project edition and when they are you agree to abide by them as applicable. . API Terms We make available a set of APIs which include documentation and associated tools to enable users to build products that promote free knowledge.

In certain (hopefully unlikely) circumstances it may be necessary for either ourselves or the Wikimedia community or its members (as described in Section ) to terminate part or all of our services terminate these Terms of Use block your account or access or ban you as a user. If your account or access is blocked or otherwise terminated for any reason your public contributions and a record of your activities on or in relation to the Projects (including any correspondence you have sent us) will be unaffected (subject to applicable policies) and you may still access our public pages for the sole purpose of reading publicly available content on the Projects. In such circumstances however you may not be able to access your account or settings. However regardless of any other provision in these Terms of Use we reserve the right to suspend or end the services at any time with or without cause and with or without notice. Even after your use and participation are banned blocked or otherwise suspended these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions including Sections - and . . Disputes and Jurisdiction Highlighted for emphasis We hope that no serious disagreements arise involving you but in the event there is a dispute we encourage you to seek resolution through the dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms provided by the Projects or Project editions and the Wikimedia Foundation. If you seek to file a legal claim against us you agree to file and resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco County California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California and to the extent applicable the laws of the United States of America will govern these Terms of Use as well as any legal claim that might arise between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of and agree that venue is proper in the courts located in San Francisco County California in any legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.

Marketing Company Mediations As described in section of these Terms of Use you agree to resolve violations of the Paid Contributions without Disclosure in a Marketing Company Mediation at the Foundation's discretion. Marketing Company Mediations are binding mediations where at the end of either a half or full day session any disputed items that remain unresolved will be decided by the mediator in a legally binding decision. They will be conducted in meetings by teleconference or videoconference. If an in-person meeting is required then the Marketing Company Mediation will take place in San Francisco County California. The parties will split all fees and expenses related to the mediation/arbitration equally. You agree as part of a Marketing Company Mediation to cooperate with the Foundation including by timely providing any documentation in your possession relating to your undisclosed paid editing activities including the accounts used articles affected and clients who purchased such services.

The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys' fees (including all fees necessary to determine the applicability of the Marketing Company Mediation and to enforce the binding result) and all costs relating to the investigation and enforcement of its rights. A party may be deemed prevailing even if it is not successful on every claim asserted. If for some reason the entirety of these Marketing Company Mediation requirements are found to be unenforceable you agree to resolve any disputes as described in the beginning of this section. .

For us personal information means information which either directly identifies you (like your name email address or billing information) or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you (like an account identification number or IP address). We ll always tell you what personal information we re collecting from you. See each product s Privacy Notice for specific details. Any information that falls outside of this is non-personal information. If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal we will consider the combination as personal information. If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information. How do we learn information about you? We learn information about you when: you give it to us directly (e.g. when you choose to send us crash reports); we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g. when your Firefox browser checks with us to see if it is up to date); someone else tells us information about you (e.g. when Thunderbird works with your email providers to set up your account); or when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g. when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services). What do we do with your information once we have it? When you give us information we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. Generally we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you. For users in the EU EEA Switzerland and California: see here for more information. When do we share your information with others? When we have asked and received your permission to share it. For processing or providing products and services to you but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla. When we are fulfilling our mission of being open . We sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web but when we do so we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified. When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information. When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else. We will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights property or safety of you our other users Mozilla or the public. If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring are acquired or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate. How do we store and protect your personal information? We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it. We implement physical business and technical security measures. Despite our efforts if we learn of a security breach we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once we don't need it we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer. What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices? We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online. If the changes are substantive we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums. Your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient we will post an effective date at the top of the page.

In particular we use data to: Provide our products which includes updating securing and troubleshooting as well as providing support. It also includes sharing data when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request. Improve and develop our products. Personalize our products and make recommendations. Advertise and market to you which includes sending promotional communications targeting advertising and presenting you with relevant offers.

In carrying out these purposes we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless consistent and personalized experience to make informed business decisions and for other legitimate purposes. Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example to build train and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including artificial intelligence or AI) we manually review some of the output produced by the automated methods against the underlying data.

We also use the data to operate our business which includes analyzing our performance meeting our legal obligations developing our workforce and doing research. For these purposes we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example from your use of two Microsoft products). For example Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law. For example where required by law we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you such as your name email address or phone number. Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing. Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.

Purposes and legal bases for processing When we process personal data about you we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use operate our business meet our contractual and legal obligations protect the security and safety of our systems and our customers or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft or third parties as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data section of this privacy statement. Our bases for processing your personal data may vary depending on how and across what products and services we process your data. When we process personal data based on our or a third party s legitimate interests we consider and balance those interests against your rights and freedoms and we will only process your personal data where the legitimate interests we have in processing are not outweighed by your interests. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement. More on the purposes of processing: Provide our products . We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich interactive experiences. For example if you use OneDrive we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve delete edit forward or otherwise process it at your direction as part of the service. Or for example if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally as communications are a feature of various products programs and activities we use data to contact you. For example we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products for example by letting you know when product updates are available. Product improvement . We use data to continually improve our products including adding new features or capabilities. For example we use error reports to improve security features search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results usage data to determine what new features to prioritize and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy. Personalization . Many products include personalized features such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product activities interests and location. For example depending on your settings if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a Microsoft account with your permission we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features. Product activation . We use data such as device and application type location and unique device application network and subscription identifiers to activate products that require activation. Product development . We use data to develop new products. For example we use data often de-identified to better understand our customers  computing and productivity needs and to train and fine-tune AI models which can shape the development of new products. Customer support . We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems repair customers  devices and provide other customer care and support services including to help us provide improve and secure the quality of our products services and training and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents. Help secure and troubleshoot . We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers detecting malware and malicious activities troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues. Safety . We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example some of our products such as Outlook.com or OneDrive systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam viruses abusive actions or URLs that have been flagged as fraud phishing or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. In accordance with European Union Regulation (EU) / we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles () and () of EU Directive //EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures (known as  hashes ) of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery (known as a  hash set ) in a process called  hash matching . Microsoft obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement authorities. Updates . We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches.

Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft. Xbox hosts an online network that consists of software and enables online experiences crossing multiple platforms. This network lets your child find and play games view content and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks. When users sign in to Xbox in apps games or on an Xbox console we assign a unique identifier to their device. For instance when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console we identify which console and which version of the console s operating system they are using. Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming. When signed in to an Xbox experience we collect required data to help keep these experiences safe secure up to date and performing as expected. Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile . You as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under years old or as otherwise specified by your jurisdiction. With your permission your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network. During the child Xbox profile creation you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group. We collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security. If your child needs help accessing their account they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account. We collect limited information about children including name birthdate email address and region. When you sign your child up for an Xbox profile they get a gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier.

(Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.) Is there an automated control such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time? If there is not a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted. Is the personal data of a sensitive type? If so a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.

Microsoft Copilot is Microsoft s everyday AI companion and is designed to help you achieve more through a single experience that runs across devices understanding relevant context on the web on your PC and across apps to bring you the right skills at the right time. With the help of Copilot users can start a draft of a new Word document; or generate a PowerPoint presentation when accessing Copilot in M apps quickly find the answers to complex search queries online find relevant documents or other personal content or be inspired to create new songs stories images or other content among other tasks. Copilot is a family of services and Microsoft s collection and use of data may differ depending on the service and the intended functionality in a given scenario. The Copilot website and app (available on iOS and Android) is the core of the consumer Copilot experience. Within this core experience users can search the web create text images songs or other outputs or engage with other features such as plugins. On the website and in the app users enter  prompts  that provide instructions to Copilot (e.g.  Give me recommendations for a restaurant that accommodates parties of near me ). In order to provide a relevant response Copilot will use this prompt along with the user s location language and similar settings to formulate a helpful response. In some markets authenticated users can choose to allow Copilot to have access to prior prompt history to better personalize the product. The consumer Copilot product uses the data collected to provide and improve the Copilot services including to provide relevant advertising. Users who are signed-in to their account can manage their prompt history in product and on the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard and can adjust their location language and other settings in the product.

Back to top OneDrive OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device. You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft or Office . When you use OneDrive we collect data about your usage of the service as well as the content you store to provide improve and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings. When you store content in OneDrive that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example if you decide to store content in the public folder the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder the content will be private. When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account your content is either uploaded to that social network or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive. When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people they will also be able to access your content even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again. Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication such as your email address and password which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft or Office service.

Back to top Diagnostics Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date secure and operating properly. It also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services. While the device is running diagnostic data is collected and periodically transmitted to Microsoft and stored along with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns. There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data. Certain product documentation and other materials refer to Required diagnostic data as Basic diagnostic data and to Optional diagnostic data as Full diagnostic data. If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft Entra ID to manage the account it provides to you and enrolls your device in the Windows diagnostic data processor configuration Microsoft s processing of diagnostic data in connection with Windows is governed by a contract between Microsoft and the organization. If an organization uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device Microsoft and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management monitoring and troubleshooting of your devices managed by the organization and for other purposes of the organization. Required diagnostic data includes information about your device its settings and capabilities and whether it is performing properly. We collect the following Required diagnostic data: Device connectivity and configuration data: Data about the device such as the processor type OEM manufacturer type of battery and capacity number and type of cameras firmware and memory attributes. Network capabilities and connection data such as the device s IP address mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator) and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network. Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number region and language settings diagnostics data settings and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program. Data about connected peripherals such as model manufacturer drivers and compatibility data. Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name version and publisher. Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates such as low battery limited disk space or connectivity through a paid network. Whether updates complete successfully or fail. Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself. Basic error reporting which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device. For example basic error reporting tells us if an application such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game hangs or crashes. Optional diagnostic data includes more detailed information about your device and its settings capabilities and device health. Optional diagnostic data may also include data about the websites you browse device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage) and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users. When you choose to send Optional diagnostic data Required diagnostic data will always be included and we collect the following additional information: Additional data about the device connectivity and configuration beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data. Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data. App activity such as which programs are launched on a device how long they run and how quickly they respond to input. Browser activity including browsing history and search terms in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer). Enhanced error reporting including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred). Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data. Microsoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample). By running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device. Instructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found in the Windows settings app under Diagnostics & feedback. Specific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described. For example to enable Microsoft to troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users  computing experience or update a Windows device that is new to the market Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously. For a current list of data types collected at Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data see Windows Required (Basic level) diagnostic events and fields or Windows Optional (Full level) diagnostic data . We provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services. They are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services. We may also share some aggregated de-identified diagnostic data such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features with selected third parties. Learn more about diagnostic data in Windows .

Back to top Location services and recording Windows location service . Microsoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device. Depending on the capabilities of the device the device s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely. When you have enabled location on a Windows device or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected. This de-identified location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services. Windows services and features apps running on Windows and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so. Some features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows some ask the first time you use the app and others ask every time you access the device s location. For information about certain Windows apps that use the device s location see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement. When an app or feature accesses the device s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you ve granted permission. We will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one). Data about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history.

Back to top Windows AI Features Click to Do Click to Do can run in partnership with Recall or as a stand-alone feature. Once started you can use Click to Do to capture and analyze screenshots and identify the presence of text and images then allowing you to take relevant actions for each. For instance Click to Do can give you options to edit a screenshot image or revise or rework text that it captures. Click to Do is unable to identify the content of the text or images identified within a screenshot but you can use local AI and other tools to modify the content if you wish. Everything remains on your local device unless you make an explicit choice like sending an image off to Bing for a search asking Click to Do to provide a summary of text the user has selected (in which case it will be sent to Microsoft s Azure AI cloud service) or using another local AI or other tool to modify a Click to Do screenshot. Click to Do also allows you to use your microphone to search for text within a capture screenshot. When you click on the microphone button Click to Do starts listening to what s said which is entered into the Search box and will highlight all the matches from the search. The audio captured by the microphone is not transmitted off your device. Windows Recall Recall is a Windows feature only available in CoPilot+ PCs that allows users to find things they've seen on their device using the text and visual clues they remember. To use Recall a user must opt-in to save snapshots on their Copilot+ PC which are images of everything open and visible on the user s screen and include associated metadata such as the app name and time-date stamp. All data is stored locally on the device and is protected with Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS) which provides more secure biometric sign-ins and helps ensure only the customer can have access to their information. Every time a user launches Recall they will be asked to authenticate using Windows Hello biometric sign-in or PIN before the contents of the snapshot folder will decrypt. Click to Do runs on top of snapshots in Recall and helps the user get things done faster by allowing them to take actions with their content either images or text on the screen. The analysis of snapshots is always performed locally on the device and the actions available to take change based on what kind of content is detected. Recall also allows you to use your Copilot+ PC device microphone as a way to search for text within captured snapshots. When you click on the microphone button located inside the Search input box within the Recall window it starts listening to what s said and enters it into the Search box. The microphone remains in use until you pause your speech at which point it is turned off until you explicitly press the microphone button again. All the matches from the search will be highlighted in the results. The audio captured by the microphone is not transmitted off your device. Data captured by Recall including personal data (e.g. snapshots metadata processing results and user queries) remain local to the device within your signed-in account on the Copilot+ PC and is not transmitted off the device unless you take certain action. For example if you copy and paste a snapshot into another app or choose to include a snapshot when submitting feedback through the Windows Feedback Hub. The only way Recall content can be shared with anyone is by explicit on-device action taken by the user. You can control your content (such as Snapshots metadata search queries and history) by pausing or deleting snapshots filtering content or using a supported browser in privacy mode. Learn more about your privacy and control over your Recall experience here . In addition to the Recall search feature Recall also has a timeline in which your snapshots are organized chronologically and visualized in a horizontal scrollbar that you can use to find and leverage your past activities on your PC. In addition to the features available within the timeline you can delete snapshots from this view either individually or by all snapshots containing a website domain (e.g. all from www.bing.com) or those from a specific app. Recall also has a Sensitive Content filter that is on by default to help prevent the retention of information that might be more delicate in nature (e.g. credit card numbers state issued ID numbers etc.). Users can turn this filter off if they wish in Windows Settings. Back to top Windows apps A number of Microsoft apps are included with Windows and others are available in Microsoft Store.
